# chan-squared

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) (Editorial note: go generators!)
version 0.11.0.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.  This will generate a node server on port 9000 (`http://localhost:9000/#/`).  This is if you want to feel awful about not running tests.  Don't use this command...

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma. (Editorial note: go tests!) AND run the application.  This is the command you'll want to run!

## Description
Remaking 4chan except in angular and with web sockets (!).
